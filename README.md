# Halal Stock Scanner

Halal stock scanner aims to help the Muslim trader/investor to quickly find out if a stock is halal to buy or not.   

[Click here to install](https://ggle.io/3UAq)

It is completely free to use and works for almost any stock. (from the US market only, currently)

We use the IFG (Islamic Finance Guru) standard for maximum allowed quantity rates, however, you can easily change the standard in our extension settings. 

We base our information on 3 main websites:  
www.marketwatch.com/   
in.reuters.com/   
ycharts.com/   
wsj.com

Currently, we only fully support the US market. We appreciate all donations to encourage us to add other markets. Our paypal is [here](https://bit.ly/3iehMeY)

if the extension has been beneficial to you, please make us du'aa.

To use it with an advanced broker software, like Questrade IQ Edge or Interactive Brokers' Traders Workstation, we recommend you to install [WindowTop](https://bityl.co/3k15) so that the Halal stock scanner stay on the top of the screen. 

You can also put a shortcut of the extension on your desktop (so you don't have to open a browser window to open a new scanner) by following these steps:

* 2 - Click on the 3-dot chrome button at the far right of the browser window.
